# 🧠 CodTech Internship - Task 4

## ✅ Task 4: Business Problem Solving using Optimization Techniques (Linear Programming)

This project demonstrates the use of **Linear Programming (LP)** to solve a **real-world business optimization problem** using Python and the `PuLP` library.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

A factory manufactures two products: **Product A** and **Product B**.

### Objective:
Maximize total profit without exceeding resource limits.

### Given:
- **Profit:**
  - Product A = ₹20/unit
  - Product B = ₹30/unit
- **Time Required:**
  - Product A = 2 hrs/unit
  - Product B = 3 hrs/unit
- **Material Required:**
  - Product A = 3 kg/unit
  - Product B = 4 kg/unit
- **Resources Available:**
  - Time = 100 hrs
  - Material = 120 kg

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) – Linear Programming solver
- Matplotlib 📊 – Visualization of constraints and optimal solution
- Google Colab – Execution environment

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Defined decision variables:** Number of units to produce for A and B.
2. **Objective Function:** Maximize total profit.
3. **Constraints:** Time and material usage must not exceed available limits.
4. **Solver:** PuLP’s built-in LP solver.
5. **Visualization:** Graphical plot of constraints and optimal point using `matplotlib`.

## 📈 Output

- **Optimal Production Plan:** X units of Product A, Y units of Product B
- **Maximum Profit Achieved:** ₹Z
- **Visual Plot:** Feasible region and optimal point marked clearly

> This project showcases how optimization can help industries make better, cost-efficient decisions using data and mathematical modeling.
